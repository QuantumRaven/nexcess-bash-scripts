# Center for Nexcess Bash Scripts
Here is where you will find all of my custom bash scripts for Nexcess, where I work.

# canned-email.sh
## Note: This script requires that you install xclip on your local device: https://man.archlinux.org/man/xclip.1.en and https://github.com/astrand/xclip
Package manager support: apt and dnf.
## Supported device(s): Your local device's user account. Do NOT use on Nexcess servers.
I created this script to speed up the outbound email process to customers by reducing as much of the manual process of writing an email from scratch each time. Feel free to customize this to fit your needs after downloading the script.

# help-request.sh
## Supported device(s): Your local device's user account. Do NOT use on Nexcess servers.
This script is simply for creating detailed help requests. Normally, I would do `ticket number - account id - domain - issue`, but I feel that was not detailed enough, so I made this.
